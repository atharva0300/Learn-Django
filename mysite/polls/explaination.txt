1. polls is the name of the app
2. The path() function contains the 4 parameters 
    => route, views, kwargs, name
    => 1. route is the string that contians the urls patterns. It compares the pattern in the 
        urlspatterns from the urls.py file in the app.  In a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3, the URLconf will also look for myapp/.
    => 2. when django finds the matching pattern from the urlpatterns, it calls the specified view function from the views.py file 
        with an HttpResponse object as the first argument and any captured values from the route as keyword arguments.
    => 3. kwargs -> arbritary keywords arguments ( dictionary ) can be passed
    => 4. name -> this means naming the url. This helps identify the webpage, determining the template
