1. checking django version -> python -m django --version
2. creating a django project -> django-admin startproject mysite,
where 'mysite' is the name of the project. The 

/*
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
*/
mysite -> container of the project 
manage.py -> this is the command utility thats helps in interacting with the django project. It is used in place of django-admin
__init__.py -> tells python that this directory should be considered as a python package
mysite -> this is a actual project ( name of the app -> mysite ), the inner mysite 
settings.py -> the settings/configuration of the app ( not the project ) like installed apps, middlewares, static files, wsgi, templates, databases
auth password validators.
urls.py -> This file maps all the urls of the project. This is the place where the urls are defined.
asgi.py -> entry point for asgi web servers 
wsgi.py -> entry point for wsgi web servers

3. running the project -> python manage.py runserver
Default port -> 8000 on the localhost
can also change the port -> python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001

4. view.py is the file that has the data which will be displayed.
